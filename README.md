# Meal Planner

This project uses Supabase as a backend. To run the app locally, create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
```

These values are injected by Vite and used by the app at runtime.

## Running tests

Execute the following command to run the Vitest suite:

```bash
npm run test
```
